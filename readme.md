## ENARSI Study

This repo will serve as a place to store all of my notes associated with my Cisco ENARSI studies. I will try to keep the repo as organized as possible, but the layout likely will not map exactly to the exam topics. I am following Nick Russo's [ENARSI Study Plan](http://njrusmc.net/jobaid/enarsi_studyplan.xlsx) and my notes will likely map better to that. 

The ulitmate goal of this repo is to store my notes, but I made it public with a hope that it might help someone else.
